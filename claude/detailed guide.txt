# **Detailed Guide: Building Your “Maximum Rice” Starter Dotfiles Repo**

---

## 1. **Plan your dotfiles repo structure**

Your dotfiles repo is the heart of your rice setup — a collection of config files, scripts, and themes that you will version control (usually with Git).

### Common directory structure:

```
dotfiles/
├── hyprland/            # Hyprland config files & pyhyprland scripts
├── waybar/              # Waybar configs + style.css
├── eww/                 # Eww widgets & dashboard configs
├── kitty/               # Kitty terminal configs
├── wezterm/             # WezTerm config files (optional if using WezTerm)
├── zsh/                 # Zsh configs + Starship prompt config
├── neovim/              # Neovim config + plugin manager files
├── mako/                # Mako notification configs
├── swaylock-effects/    # Lockscreen configs
├── hyprpaper/           # Wallpaper configs & scripts
├── pywal/               # Pywal custom scripts & color schemes
├── kvantum/             # Kvantum themes for Qt apps
├── scripts/             # Automation scripts (theme switchers, workspace rules)
├── autostart/           # Hyprland autostart scripts
├── fonts/               # Fonts (JetBrains Mono, Nerd Fonts, etc.)
├── README.md            # Documentation & installation instructions
└── install.sh           # Installation bootstrap script (optional)
```

**Why organize this way?**

* Keeps configs modular and easy to maintain.
* You can add or remove components without breaking the whole setup.
* Easy to share and version control.

---

## 2. **Set up your Git repo and dotfiles manager**

* Create a **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket** repo named `dotfiles` or similar.
* Use a dotfiles manager like:

  * **GNU Stow**: Symlink configs to proper locations easily.
  * **Chezmoi** or **Dotbot**: More powerful dotfile management with templates.
* This helps keep your home directory clean and makes installing your rice on a new system painless.

---

## 3. **Install core tools and dependencies**

On your ASUS TUF with 16GB RAM and NVIDIA GTX 1650, install these base packages **before applying configs**:

### Essential system tools

* `git` — for version control
* `curl` or `wget` — downloading scripts
* `make` / `gcc` — building tools if needed
* `stow` or chosen dotfile manager
* `python3` (for scripts and pyhyprland)
* `lua` (for Neovim plugins)

### Window manager and Wayland ecosystem

* `hyprland` (latest version)
* `waybar` + its dependencies (libjson, libpulse, etc.)
* `eww` (compile or install from package if available)
* `mako` (notification daemon)
* `swaylock-effects` (lockscreen)
* `hyprpaper` (wallpaper manager)
* `swww` (animated wallpapers, optional)

### Terminal & shell

* `kitty` and/or `wezterm` (install binaries or via your package manager)
* `zsh` + `starship` prompt
* `tmux` or `zellij` for terminal multiplexing

### Theming & fonts

* `pywal` (Python package)
* `kvantum` (Qt theme engine)
* Download and install Nerd Fonts, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Iosevka, etc.

### Other utilities

* `ranger` or `lf` (file manager)
* `neovim` (latest stable) + plugin manager (lazy.nvim, packer.nvim)
* `flameshot` (screenshots)
* `obs-studio` or `wf-recorder` (screen recording)
* `glava` or `cava` (music visualizers)
* Clipboard manager (greenclip or copyq)

## 4. **NVIDIA driver considerations**

Since you have an NVIDIA GPU, **special care is needed** to get Wayland and Hyprland working smoothly.

### Steps:

* Install official NVIDIA drivers from your distro’s repos or NVIDIA’s site.

* Enable **GBM** backend support (most Wayland compositors prefer this over EGLStreams).

* Use the **latest Hyprland version** — it has better NVIDIA support now.

* Set environment variables to enable proper rendering, like:

  ```
  __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
  WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1
  ```

* If using `hyprpaper` or animated wallpapers, test GPU resource usage carefully.

* Avoid or limit heavy effects if performance dips — blur/shadow can be expensive on NVIDIA.

---

## 5. **Create modular configs**

Start with **basic functional configs** for each tool, then incrementally add:

* Hyprland config: monitors, DPI, workspaces, keybindings, blur/shadow settings
* Waybar: modular bar with CPU, RAM, network, battery widgets styled in CSS
* Eww: widget panels for system info, music controls, clocks, weather
* Kitty: font size, ligatures, colors (sync with Pywal)
* Zsh: prompt, aliases, completions, Starship config
* Neovim: minimal config with plugin manager and theme syncing
* Mako: notification styling, timeout durations
* Lockscreen: swaylock-effects with blur and animation

---

## 6. **Write automation & helper scripts**

* Scripts to **auto-switch themes** based on time or wallpaper changes (using Pywal)
* Workspace management scripts in `pyhyprland` to auto-move apps or set window rules
* Autostart script to launch all background apps (Waybar, Eww daemon, Mako, etc.) on login
* GPU load monitoring to disable some effects if temps rise too high (optional, advanced)

---

## 7. **Fonts & icons**

* Store custom fonts inside your dotfiles repo for easy installation
* Include instructions or scripts for installing fonts system-wide
* Use popular icon sets like Papirus or Tela — store your favorites in the repo
* Fix any hardcoded icon issues with tools like **hardcode-fixer**

---

## 8. **Documentation**

Your `README.md` should include:

* Installation instructions (clone repo, run install script, etc.)
* Prerequisites and dependencies list
* How to enable NVIDIA-specific environment variables and troubleshooting
* How to customize themes, add/remove widgets, tweak configs
* How to update configs and reload Hyprland/Waybar/Eww without reboot

---

## 9. **Test and iterate**

* Start simple: get Hyprland running with basic monitor setup and keybindings
* Add Waybar and Mako for status and notifications
* Add Eww widgets one by one, testing responsiveness and layout
* Slowly add themed elements (Pywal + Kvantum) and terminal config
* Test GPU load and responsiveness with NVIDIA — disable effects if needed
* Use community configs and dotfiles for ideas and troubleshooting

---

## 10. **Bonus: Optional polish**

* Use **dmenu/fuzzel/anyrun** for launchers integrated into your setup
* Add dynamic wallpapers (Hyprpaper + swww)
* Use **Glava** for music visualization integrated with Eww widgets
* Add system monitoring dashboards using Eww or Conky
* Automate backup and syncing of your dotfiles repo via cron or Git hooks

---

When you’re ready, I can help you write the **install script**, the **initial configs**, and the **automation scripts** to get this rolling quickly.

Would you like to proceed with that next? Or do you want to focus on building one module first (e.g., Hyprland config or Eww dashboard)?
