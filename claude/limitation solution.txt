Absolutely, that’s a **smart and scalable approach**! Making separate profiles/configurations for different hardware classes lets you **maximize the rice experience for each tier**, adapting gracefully to limitations while preserving the spirit of “maximum rice.” Here’s a detailed guide on how to organize and implement this:

---

# **1. Define Hardware Profiles**

Start by categorizing your hardware into distinct profiles, e.g.:

| Profile          | Example Hardware                    | Key Constraints                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Low-end          | 4GB RAM, integrated GPU, older CPU  | Minimal RAM & GPU, weaker CPU          |
| Mid-range        | 8-16GB RAM, integrated or entry GPU | Moderate CPU/GPU, decent RAM           |
| Mid-range Gaming | Your ASUS TUF (16GB RAM, GTX1650)   | Dedicated GPU, good CPU, plenty of RAM |
| High-end         | 32+GB RAM, RTX 30/40 series         | Powerful CPU/GPU, large RAM            |
| ARM Devices      | Raspberry Pi, Pinebook              | Low CPU power, limited GPU, low RAM    |

# **2. Modularize Your Dotfiles Setup**

Design your dotfiles **to load and apply different configurations depending on the detected profile**.

### How?

* Have a **core config** for universal stuff (basic Hyprland, shell, essential apps).

* Create **profile-specific config folders or scripts**:

  * `configs/low-end/`
  * `configs/mid-range/`
  * `configs/mid-range-gaming/`
  * `configs/high-end/`
  * `configs/arm/`

* Your **install/setup script** detects hardware specs (RAM, CPU, GPU) and **selects the right profile to apply**.

---

# **3. Hardware Detection Logic**

Use scripts (bash, python, or rust) that run checks:

* RAM: `grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo`
* CPU: `lscpu` output for cores & model
* GPU: `lspci | grep VGA` or `nvidia-smi` for NVIDIA cards
* Platform/arch: `uname -m` (x86_64 vs aarch64)

Example pseudo-logic:

```bash
if arch == aarch64; then
    profile=arm
elif ram < 6GB; then
    profile=low-end
elif gpu == nvidia & ram > 12GB; then
    profile=mid-range-gaming
elif ram > 24GB; then
    profile=high-end
else
    profile=mid-range
fi
```

# **4. Tailoring Configs Per Profile**

### Low-End Profile

* Disable blur, shadows, and animations in Hyprland.
* Use simple Waybar modules or a minimal bar.
* Avoid Eww or reduce widgets count drastically.
* Use lightweight terminals (Kitty with minimal features or Alacritty).
* Disable heavy system monitors; use `htop` only.
* Use static wallpapers.
* Avoid heavy shell prompts or complicated scripts.
* Use basic lockscreen (e.g., `swaylock` without effects).

---

### Mid-Range Profile

* Enable some blur/shadow effects with low intensity.
* Use more Waybar modules (network, battery, cpu, ram).
* Eww with fewer widgets or simple dashboards.
* Animated wallpapers if GPU can handle.
* Full shell prompt with Starship but optimized for performance.

---

### Mid-Range Gaming Profile (Your current setup)

* Full Hyprland effects: blur, shadows, animations.
* Full Eww dashboard with system monitoring widgets.
* Animated wallpapers with swww.
* All CLI tools enabled.
* Complex starship prompt and terminal multiplexers.
* GPU accelerated visualizers (Glava, cava).
* Optimized NVIDIA driver configuration.

---

### High-End Profile

* Same as mid-range gaming but maxed out:

  * Higher blur radius, more animations, multi-monitor scaling.
  * Extra system monitoring dashboards.
  * More background services if desired (e.g., background indexing).
  * Support for VRR/HDR if hardware supports it.

---

### ARM Profile

* Disable all heavy effects and animations.
* Use minimal Waybar config.
* Static wallpapers only.
* Use lightweight terminal & shell prompt (avoid heavy font ligatures, no starship).
* Disable visualizers and complex widgets.
* Simple lockscreen.
* Minimal autostart apps to save CPU.

---

# **5. GPU-Specific Adjustments**

Within each profile, you can further tweak based on GPU vendor and capability:

* **NVIDIA proprietary drivers:**

  * Enable proprietary driver config files, environment variables.
  * Use Hyprland’s NVIDIA backend properly configured.

* **Intel/AMD GPUs:**

  * Use open-source drivers by default.
  * Enable specific compositor flags for better performance.

* **No dedicated GPU (integrated only):**

  * Disable GPU-heavy effects.
  * Lower refresh rate settings if necessary.
  * Possibly fallback to X11 for better compatibility.

---

# **6. Dynamic Switching and User Overrides**

* Allow the user to **override the auto-selected profile** by passing flags to the install script or setting environment variables.
* Provide a **profile switcher script** to apply a different config later without reinstalling.

---

# **7. Documentation and Maintenance**

* Document clearly in README what each profile supports and what sacrifices are made.
* Keep the profiles updated independently to accommodate new software/hardware trends.
* Encourage users to submit PRs for new profiles or improvements.

---

If you want, I can help you **design this modular dotfiles repo structure** and **write the detection/install scripts** for this approach, ensuring your “max rice” concept scales elegantly to any hardware and distro.

Would you like to proceed with that?
